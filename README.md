Packet Sniffing and Analysis Tool

### Environment Setup
- Need to have Golang version 1.18+ installed
- You'll also likely need to install a package called libpcap-dev or libpcap-devel (depending on what package manager you're using) to handle a pcap.h error


Steps:

- Test this in the lab with a prometheus server and see what performance is like
- Create config logic to decide what input and output gets selected
- Add switches into the code to allow certain analysis and statistics to be or not be reported
