Packet Sniffing and Analysis Tool

Steps:

1) Get it to read pcap file and generate stats
2) Break read and stats out into inputs and outputs
    - analysis done and stats generated will be part of the output since it's output dependent
3) Create tcpdump input
4) Create PromQL output
5) Create config logic to decide what input and output gets selected
