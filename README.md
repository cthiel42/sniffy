Packet Sniffing and Analysis Tool

### Environment Setup
- Need to have Golang version 1.18+ installed
- You'll also likely need to install a package called libpcap-dev or libpcap-devel (depending on what package manager you're using) to handle a pcap.h error


Steps:

1) Create PromQL output
2) Create config logic to decide what input and output gets selected
3) Add switches into the code to allow certain analysis and statistics to be or not be reported
